# Binary Search Tree

The aim of this project is to write a program which is capable of constructing a binary search tree (BST) from an array. In addition, it can call the following methods on the constructed tree:

1. insert - Takes a value and inserts it as a node on the BST
2. delete - Takes a value and deletes the corresponding node from the BST
3. find - Takes a value and returns the corresponding node in the BST
4. level_order - Returns the elements of the BST as a level-ordered array
5. inorder - Returns the elements of the BST as an inorder array
6. preorder - Returns the elements of the BST as a preordered array
7. postorder - Returns the elements of the BST as a postordered array
8. height - Takes a node and returns its height in the BST
9. depth - Takes a node and returns its depth in the BST
8. balanced? - Returns true or false based on whether or not the tree is balanced, respectively
9. rebalance - Rebalances an unbalanced tree
